<p id="description" class="text-muted">(This incident happened before ACPD was created) So this random kid was trying to steal our floaties. We kept on escaping him and he kept on chasing. The main reason why it was weird was because the kid was mainly chasing our Pop-Tart floatie and was calling it a "Sprinkle Cake."</p>

<p id="description" class="text-muted">While we were touring a mall in Canada, there was the crazy man who was running up and down the escalator and was pushing people who were in his way. I may have even saw him jump off a escalator. My dad saw him getting close to Juliana and was ready to punch the man. We were paranoid after he left.</p>
